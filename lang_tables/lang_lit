// This is kinda hacky because Lit uses '-' symbol for keywords
// for instance: set-integrator is one token. However our lexer
// does not support breaking out the divider list so we hack
// the lexer by letting it split 'set-integrator' into 3 tokens:
// 'set'   +  '-'   + 'integrator'. At somepoint we might
// want to allow for a more robust divider list on the lexer
// but it is not a must now.
